### Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing is the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the need for a
more efficient and accurate way of identifying individuals who are at risk. Current diagnostic
methods rely on invasive tests and can be time-consuming and costly, leading to delays in
treatment and poor health outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive tool that can use
demographic and lifestyle information to accurately identify individuals who are at risk of
developing type 2 diabetes, allowing for early intervention and prevention measures.
#### Objectives for this project :
● Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict diseases based on
symptoms reported by the patient.

● Evaluate the performance of the model using real-world patient data.

● Optimize the model to improve its accuracy and efficiency.

● Implement the model into a user-friendly Web page that patients can easily access and
use.

● Deploy the web page on Azure App services
