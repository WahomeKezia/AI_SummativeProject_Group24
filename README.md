### Problem Statement

The problem we are addressing is the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the need for a
more efficient and accurate way of identifying individuals who are at risk. Current diagnostic
methods rely on invasive tests and can be time-consuming and costly, leading to delays in
treatment and poor health outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive tool that can use
demographic and lifestyle information to accurately identify individuals who are at risk of
developing type 2 diabetes, allowing for early intervention and prevention measures.

#### Objectives for this project :

● Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict Type2 Diabetes based on
data given by the patient.

● Evaluate the performance of the model using real-world patient data.

● Deploy the Machine Learning Model to Azure so that it is easily accessible through a web domain .

● Use the deployed Model as an API to a user-friendly Web page that patients can easily access and
use.

### Technologies Used :

● Python for Model Training and Flask App 

● ReactJs for the frontend Interface  

● Azure app service for cloud Deployment

There are two part to this project , 

1. Frontend Reactapp

See the App [Readme ](https://github.com/WahomeKezia/AI_SummativeProject_Group24/tree/main/GlucoGuardapp) for informantion 

2. Flaskapp  -the ML API  [here](https://github.com/WahomeKezia/FlaskApp_API)

To run the Flask App use this commands 

`git clone https://github.com/WahomeKezia/FlaskApp_API`

 `pip install gunicorn`
 
 `gunicorn wsgi:app`
 
 This will run the application locally 
 
 
 ### Deployed Access:
 

Access the deployed ML API [here](https://flaskappdiabetics.azurewebsites.net/)
