A disease predicting model deployed on Azure  

## Introudction
Disease prediction based on symptoms using machine learning has become an increasingly
popular area of research due to the advancement of technology and the availability of medical
data. With the widespread use of smartphones and other devices, people can now easily report
their symptoms, which can be used for disease prediction. According to a study published in the
Journal of Medical Internet Research, patients are increasingly interested in using chatbots for
healthcare-related communication. The study found that patients were willing to use chatbots for
various healthcare-related tasks, including making appointments, receiving test results, and
asking general health-related questions.
Furthermore, a survey conducted by Accenture found that 75% of patients would use digital
health services, such as chatbots, if they were available. Additionally, a report by Grand View
Research suggests that the global healthcare chatbots market size is expected to grow at a CAGR
of 25.1% from 2020 to 2027. These statistics indicate that there is a growing interest in
healthcare chatbot systems,
This technology can be applied to various medical fields, including general medicine,
telemedicine, and public health. The main objective of this project is to develop a disease
prediction model using machine learning algorithms that can accurately predict the disease based
on the symptoms reported by the patient.


### Problem Statement
The problem we are addressing is the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the need for a
more efficient and accurate way of identifying individuals who are at risk. Current diagnostic
methods rely on invasive tests and can be time-consuming and costly, leading to delays in
treatment and poor health outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive tool that can use
demographic and lifestyle information to accurately identify individuals who are at risk of
developing type 2 diabetes, allowing for early intervention and prevention measures.
#### Objectives:
● Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict diseases based on
symptoms reported by the patient.

● Implement the model into a user-friendly Web page that patients can easily access and
use.

● Evaluate the performance of the model using real-world patient data.

● Optimize the model to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
